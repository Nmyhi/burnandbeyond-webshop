## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

Burn and Beyond webshop is a fully functioning Ecommerce web application which hosts various laser-cut goods in categories like: Home Decor and Gifts.
This site exist because of my own personal goal which is to eventually sell my laser-cut products online.

#### Key information for the site

In this site my goal was to create a fully functioning ecommerce web application with real payments later on. I have used django framework, stripe and Amazon web services to accomplish it.

* Log-in to account
* Log-out
* Place purchases
* Browse products

## Design

## Database

- [Database design considerations](DATABASE_README.md)

### Colour Scheme

I have chosen a modern sceme for this project and tried to make it interesting.

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

![Colour Scheme](URL).

### Typography

I have chosen Lato and Pacifico google font family.

[Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)
[Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico/about)

I chose for this font family because I think it appeares to be something fit well into my project.
I think it is an accessible friendly font because the characters are uppercase and easy to read.
I used font-weight 400.

![Pacifico font](/static/images/pacifico_font.png)
![Lato font](/static/images/lato_font.png)

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

I used colourful icon images for this project for the categories and a logo generator for my brand logo.
I used a favicon crator for my favicon.

![Brand Logo](static/images/burn_and_beyond_logo.png)
![Favicon](static/images/favicon.ico)

[Logo Maker](https://logomakr.com/)

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the R

## Features

### General features on each page

The website contains:

- Home page
- User page
- Login page/Logout
- Register

These pages DOM are modified by the python code flask and jinja2 syntax.

All pages on the website are responsive and have:

- A favicon in the browser tab.

![Favicon tab](/budgetpal/static/images/favicon_tab.png)

- A header with brand logo and navbar.

![Navbar screenshot](/budgetpal/static/images/navbar.png)

![Footer screenshot](/budgetpal/static/images/footer.png)

- Home page:

The home page welcome the user logged in or ask the user to log in if there is no user logged in yet:

- User logged in:
  ![User logged in home screen](/budgetpal/static/images/homepage_user_logged_in.png)

- User logged out:
  ![User logged out home screen](/budgetpal/static/images/homepage_user_logged_out.png)

- User Page:

The user pages displays the user's balance Savings and expenses when the user is logged in and showing the control buttons as well. The user can edit delete and add expenses and income, savings and add new categories:

- User page logged in:
  ![User logged in userpage](/budgetpal/static/images/userpage_logged_in.png)

- expenses form:
  ![expenses form](/budgetpal/static/images/expense_form.png)
- Userpage logged out:
  ![User logged out in userpage](/budgetpal/static/images/userpage_logged_out.png)
- Login page:

The login page is accessible from the navbar if a user is not logged in. If a user is logged in the navbar displays the logout option only:

- Login page user logged out:
  ![Login page](/budgetpal/static/images/login_page_user_not_logged_in.png)

- Registration page:

The resistration page is always accessible in case the user wants to register a new account
![Registration page](/budgetpal/static/images/registration_page.png)

### Future Implementations

* Comment and rate products
* Contact the Store
* Login using social accounts
* Allow superusers to add categories
* Allow superusers to edit categories
* Allow superusers to delete categories
* Allow users and superusers to upload profile image
* Switch between light and dark theme


### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible.
- Using rel attributes on the anchor tags.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python were used to create this website.
I used Flask login method and jinja2 language and templating.
The database is PSQL.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

- Migrate your database:

- Register on ElephantSQL
- Navigate to ElephantSQL.com and click “Log in”
- Select “Sign in with GitHub”
- Authorise ElephantSQL with your selected GitHub account
  \*In the Create new team form:
  Add a team name (your own name is fine)
  Read and agree to the Terms of Service
  Select Yes for GDPR
  Provide your email address
  Click “Create Team”
- Your account is successfully created!
- Click “Create New Instance”
  \*Set up your plan
  Give your plan a Name (this is commonly the name of the project)
  Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan
  You can leave the Tags field blank
- Select “Select Region”
- Select a data center near you
- Then click “Review”
- Check your details are correct and then click “Create instance”
- Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project
- In the URL section, clicking the copy icon will copy the database URL to your clipboard
- Leave this tab open, we will come back here later

- In your IDE workspace:

\*Before we can build our application on Heroku, we need to create a few files that Heroku will need to run our application:

    A requirements.txt file which contains a list of the Python dependencies that our project needs in order to run successfully.

    A Procfile which contains the start command to run the project.

- Generate the requirements.txt file with the following command in the terminal. After you run this command a new file called requirements.txt should appear in your root directory

pip freeze --local > requirements.txt

- add a runtime.txt file to the root directory and add this:

python-3.9.17

- add this line to requirements.txt:

blinker==1.7.0

- Heroku requires a Procfile containing a command to run your program. Inside the root directory of your project create the new file. It must be called Procfile with a capital P, otherwise Heroku won’t recognise it

- Inside the file, add the following command
  web: python run.py

- Open your **init**.py file
- Add an if statement before the line setting the SLQALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI and, in the else, set the value to reference a new variable, DATABASE_URL.

app = Flask(**name**)
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")

if os.environ.get("DEVELOPMENT") == "True":
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = os.environ.get("DB_URL")
else:
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")

- To ensure that SQLAlchemy can also read our external database, its URL needs to start with “postgresql://”, but we should not change this in the environment variable. Instead, we’ll make an addition to our else statement from the previous step to adjust our DATABASE_URL in case it starts with postgres://:

if os.environ.get("DEVELOPMENT") == "True":
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = os.environ.get("DB_URL")
else:
uri = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")
if uri.startswith("postgres://"):
uri = uri.replace("postgres://", "postgresql://", 1)
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = uri

- In your run.py set the debug mode off:

import os
from budgetpal import app

if **name** == "**main**":
app.run(
host=os.environ.get("IP"),
port=int(os.environ.get("PORT")),
debug=False
)

- Save all your files and then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub

- Heroku setup and deployment:

- Log into Heroku.com and click “New” and then “Create a new app”

- Choose a unique name for your app, select the region closest to you and click “Create app”

- Go to the Settings tab of your new app

- Click Reveal Config Vars

- Return to your ElephantSQL tab and copy your database URL

- Back on Heroku, add a Config Var called DATABASE_URL and paste your ElephantSQL database URL in as the value. Make sure you click “Add”

- Add each of your other environment variables except DEVELOPMENT and DB_URL from the env.py file as a Config Var. The result should look something like this:

- Navigate to the “Deploy” tab of your app

- In the Deployment method section, select “Connect to GitHub”

- Search for your repo and click Connect

- As we already have all our changes pushed to GitHub, we will use the Manual deploy section and click Deploy Branch. This will start the build process. When finished, it should look something like this

- Now, we have our project in place, and we have an empty database ready for use. As you may remember from our local development, we still need to add our tables to our database. To do this, we can click the “More” button and select “Run console”

- Type python3 into the console and click Run

from budgetpal import db
db.create_all()

- Exit the Python terminal, by typing exit() and hitting enter, and close the console. Our Heroku database should now have the tables and columns created from our models.py file.

- The app should be up and running now, so click the “Open app” button

- Your deployed app will load, but as your new database is empty there won’t be any categories or tasks displayed yet.

Test that you can Create, Read, Update and Delete both the Categories and Tasks for this application.

- Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your app to Heroku!

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

I have created the full testing documentation which collects all the information into a test sheet. [Testing documentation](TESTING.md)

## Credits

- [Online tutorial](https://betterprogramming.pub/a-detailed-guide-to-user-registration-login-and-logout-in-flask-e86535665c07 "Tutorial for Flask-login") Was used for creating the registration login and logout functionality using Flask-login.
- [Online documentations](https://www.w3schools.com/ "online documentation for html") was used for researching html css and javaScript elements, properties, attributes and functions.
- [Google](https://www.google.com/ "I think I do not have to introduce google") was used for researching.

### Code Used

In the project I used small code blocks from the online documentations and other resources I have highlighted in the credits section as well.

### Content

I have made the project myself.

###  Media

I have made / downloaded the media myself using the sources I have highighted before.

###  Acknowledgments

- Jubril Akolade - came up with some things I'd have easily missed and was a really good and professional guide.
- Callum Jones - for turning up consistently and offering helpful advice and tips and kept track on my journey.
