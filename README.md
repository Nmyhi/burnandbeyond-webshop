## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

Burn and Beyond webshop is a fully functioning Ecommerce web application which hosts various laser-cut goods in categories like: Home Decor and Gifts.
This site exist because of my own personal goal which is to eventually sell my laser-cut products online.

#### Key information for the site

In this site my goal was to create a fully functioning ecommerce web application with real payments later on. I have used django framework, stripe and Amazon web services to accomplish it.

* Log-in to account
* Log-out
* Place purchases

## Design

## Database

- [Database design considerations](DATABASE_README.md)

### Colour Scheme

I have chosen a modern sceme for this project and tried to make it interesting, fun and special.

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

![Colour Scheme](static/images/burnandbeyond_colors.png).

### Typography

I have chosen Lato and Pacifico google font family.

[Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)
[Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico/about)

I chose for this font family because I think it appeares to be something fit well into my project.
I think it is an accessible friendly font because the characters are easy to read.

![Pacifico font](/static/images/pacifico_font.png)
![Lato font](/static/images/lato_font.png)

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

I used colourful icon images for this project for the prducts and a logo generator for my brand logo.
I used a favicon crator for my favicon.
The product images are my own products I have developed with my laser-cutter and my mom's hand crochet products.

![Brand Logo](static/images/burn_and_beyond_logo.png)

![Favicon](static/images/favicon.ico)

I have used an online favicon creator for the favicon and logo maker to create the shop logo.

[Logo Maker](https://logomakr.com/)

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the R

## Features

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible.
- Using rel attributes on the anchor tags.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python were used to create this website.
I used Flask login method and jinja2 language and templating.
The database is PSQL.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

- Migrate your database:

- Register on ElephantSQL
- Navigate to ElephantSQL.com and click “Log in”
- Select “Sign in with GitHub”
- Authorise ElephantSQL with your selected GitHub account
  \*In the Create new team form:
  Add a team name (your own name is fine)
  Read and agree to the Terms of Service
  Select Yes for GDPR
  Provide your email address
  Click “Create Team”
- Your account is successfully created!
- Click “Create New Instance”
  \*Set up your plan
  Give your plan a Name (this is commonly the name of the project)
  Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan
  You can leave the Tags field blank
- Select “Select Region”
- Select a data center near you
- Then click “Review”
- Check your details are correct and then click “Create instance”
- Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project
- In the URL section, clicking the copy icon will copy the database URL to your clipboard
- Leave this tab open, we will come back here later

- In your IDE workspace:

- In the terminal, install dj_database_url and psycopg2, both of these are needed to connect to your external database

 pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2

- Update your requirements.txt file with the newly installed packages

   pip freeze > requirements.txt

- In your settings.py file, import dj_database_url underneath the import for os

  import os
  import dj_database_url

Scroll to the DATABASES section and update it to the following code, so that the original connection to sqlite3 is commented out and we connect to the new ElephantSQL database instead. Paste in your ElephantSQL database URL in the position indicated

 # DATABASES = {
 #     'default': {
 #         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
 #         'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
 #     }
 # }
     
 DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-database-url-here')
 }

DO NOT commit this file with your database string in the code, this is temporary so that we can connect to the new database and make migrations. We will remove it in a moment.

In the terminal, run the showmigrations command to confirm you are connected to the external database

 python3 manage.py showmigrations

If you are, you should see a list of all migrations, but none of them are checked off

- Migrate your database models to your new database

  python3 manage.py migrate

- Load in the fixtures. Please note the order is very important here. We need to load categories first

   python3 manage.py loaddata categories

- Then products, as the products require a category to be set

  python3 manage.py loaddata products

- Create a superuser for your new database

  python3 manage.py createsuperuser

- Finally, to prevent exposing our database when we push to GitHub, we will delete it again from our settings.py - we’ll set it up again  using an environment variable in the next video - and reconnect to our local sqlite database. For now, your DATABASE setting in the settings.py file should look like this

DATABASES = {
     'default': {
         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
         'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
     }
 }

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

I have created the full testing documentation which collects all the information into a test sheet. [Testing documentation](TESTING.md)

## Credits

- [Online tutorial](https://betterprogramming.pub/a-detailed-guide-to-user-registration-login-and-logout-in-flask-e86535665c07 "Tutorial for Flask-login") Was used for creating the registration login and logout functionality using Flask-login.
- [Online documentations](https://www.w3schools.com/ "online documentation for html") was used for researching html css and javaScript elements, properties, attributes and functions.
- [Google](https://www.google.com/ "I think I do not have to introduce google") was used for researching.

### Code Used

In the project I used small code blocks from the online documentations and other resources I have highlighted in the credits section as well.

### Content

I have made the project myself.

###  Media

I have made / downloaded the media myself using the sources I have highighted before.

###  Acknowledgments

- Jubril Akolade - came up with some things I'd have easily missed and was a really good and professional guide.
